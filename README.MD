### Building

To build plugin, run `./gradlew jar`. Output should be in `build/libs`.

Troubleshooting: If you see error like `./gradlew: Permission denied`, proceed `chmod +x ./gradlew`

### Installing

Move output jar to your server's `config/mods` directory and restart the server.

If it installed, you will see something like `[XX-XX-XXXX XX:XX:XX] [I] Kycb plugin loaded.`

You can check installed plugin list using `mods` server command.
